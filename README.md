# Portfolio

This is a portfolio idea I had floating around. I want to keep things simple, but still have fun while doing it.

-bugs to fix. 

-cloud indexing is off a bit
-change text color to P tags.
-re-establish a connection with @media queries.
-find a little more to say
-add a different animation to each page.
-fix all around fonts/color schemes

-have fun!
